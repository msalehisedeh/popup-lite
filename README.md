# Welcome to Popup Lite!

Have you ever wanted to have a lite weight modal popup, dialogue box, or free moving window? Well... I needed one. And here it is... a lite weight pop-up fully configurable with modal, dialog, and free workspace like window... all in one package!

This library provides Angular 4 components that enables you to have such things without relying on heavy **"@angular/material"** and just by adding PopupLiteModule into your AppModule.

**NOTE:** If your project still is angular 2, 4, or 5; please luck-down your version reference to flexible table to 1.2.1 version by removing ^ from the version dependency in your package json. Otherwise for Angular 6+, please use 1.2.2 version or higher.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.3.1 you need to import this library through @sedeh/popup-lite.
